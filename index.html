        /*  
        Week 1 (2025/09/19) Practical Course Progress - Sorting the Students' Scores (SSS)
Sorting the Students' Scores (SSS)

Problem

       Write a C++ program to sort the student records according to their scores. Define a Student class (or struct) which records the scores of Mathematic, English , and Chinese classes. 
       Please sort the students' records in a decreasing order by the average of three scores. 
       M = 70, E = 90, C = 100 
       averA = (M + E + C)/ 3.0 = 260/3.0 = 86.67
       M = 50, E = 50, C = 90 
       averB = 190/3 = 63.33
         M = 90, E = 70, C = 100 
        averC = 86.67

         M = 50, E = 90, C = 50 
         averD = 63.33

       If two students have the same average score, sort them by the higher score of Mathematic class first,
        and then by the score of English class.
 

Requirement 1. Use C++ new (delete) operators for dynamic memory allocation (deallocation) of a Student sturct array.      
    2. Use std::sort() in <algorithm> header file.
       

Input

    The input is an integer N followed by N students' scores line by line. The input format of each student's record is shown below:

M: xxx E: xxx C: xxx

Output
       The output format is shown as the Sample Output.
